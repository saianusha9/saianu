                 FITTORCH is all about exercise equipment is any apparatus or device used during physical activity to enhance the strength 
                 or conditioning effects of that exercise by providing either fixed or adjustable amounts of resistance, or to otherwise enhance the experience
                 or outcome of an exercise routine.
             Exercise equipment may also include such wearable items as proper footgear, gloves, and hydration packs.

             It is important to use exercise equipment properly: inappropriate use of equipment can lead to injuries from mild to extreme
